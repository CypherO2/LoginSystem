Step 5: Create a Hashing System using college resources as BASE (will expand once details have been confirmed and verified with practice)

Step 6: Build True Database - No INITIAL population beyond (hypothetical) staff members

Step 7: Setup JSON sending + Receiving integration from the backend utilising a Python Functions file (will be created) 

Step 8: Setup JSON sending + Receiving integration from the frontend utilising the react integration for such + API and Axiom ( ;-; ) 

Step 9: Link Database to Primary Python File 

Step 10: Host the Primary PYTHON File to the Flask Server environment 

Step 11: Link the Primary PYTHON file to the REACT project alongside the Flask Server Environment
